Brief Description

1. I would start by designing the UI for both the              carousel and the customizable product section. I             took reference from internet for optimizing my work 

2.  I select html, css and js for building my both the      projects.

For Carousel:

I added a header describing our brand name. 

I used five sliders, made it full responsive and user friendly using js functions @media screen for max 800px and 520px.

As directed I enabled manually movement of products using <> arrows. There also been added five dots that is more friendly with and help user to know at which product they are and can move directly to their desire one.

For Custom pack:

I build a grid having three rows and three colums. Each items are equally spaced.

For adding items to list I prefer to store all the products in one variable in javascript so that we can use it for dynamically adding the variable as well.

I give this a fuctionality that user cannot add more that 8 items by applying control if-else condition over count variable in reloadCard function. Also enable an alert message while exceeding the limit.

It has automatic price calculating feature. also one can increase and decrease quantity of product which can also applicable using js.
